    <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Have you ever made homemade beef bone broth?
        
        Part of our goal with our farm is to make unique cuts of beef less intimidating. Beef Bones is a cut of beef that 
        many people find intimidating, but they are a wonderful addition to any kitchen. With only beef bones and water, you
        can make flavorful bone broth that is the base of many soups, stews, sauces and gravy.
        
        Although we know that it’s much easier to buy broth at a local store, homemade bone broth tastes so much better and
         it’s made with real food — beef bones and water.
        
        WHAT IS BONE BROTH?
        Bone Broth is nutrient-dense, collagen-rich liquid made from simmering animal bones (beef, chicken, turkey, fish,
         pork) in water for an extended period of time. In its most basic form, bone broth only requires bones and water 
         to make. However, you can also add vegetables, fresh herbs and spices for extra flavor.
        
        In this post, we will be focused on beef bone broth. But, once you discover how easy it is to make, you can make 
        other broths, like chicken broth from chicken bones. Beef broth and chicken bone broth have many of the same steps,</p>
